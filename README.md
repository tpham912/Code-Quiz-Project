The Code Quiz Project is an interactive trivia quiz application that challenges users with a series of multiple-choice questions. The quiz tests users' knowledge on topics ranging from coding concepts to pop culture. With a built-in timer, users have a limited time to answer each question, adding an element of urgency and excitement to the quiz experience.

- Score Calculation: Each correct answer earns the user 2 points. The total score is displayed at the end of the quiz.

- Timer Expiration: If the timer reaches zero, the quiz automatically ends, and the user’s score will be displayed.

- Responsive UI: The user interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
